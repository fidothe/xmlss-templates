# XML Summer School 2012 Slide Template

This project contains a skeletal project that provides the XML Summer
School "look and feel" from web sources.

## HTML support

For authoring in HTML, see `src/slides.xml`

## DocBook support

For authoring in DocBook, see `src/dbslides.xml`

You'll probably also have to ask Norm some questions.

Consult the `Makefile` for the commands to run. The distribution now includes
the jar files necessary to construct the HTML output with the Pygments syntax
highlighting.
